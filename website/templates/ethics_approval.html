        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
        We are a group of researchers at the University of Nottingham studying forced marriage in
        the UK and around the world. We are interested in understanding the prevalence of forced
        marriage in different regions of the UK.

        At the moment there is no reliable base-line data about the prevalence of forced marriage
        in the UK. This makes it very hard to judge whether government policies, or the actions of
        specialist support services, police, social-services, local government, or schools (to name
        just a few key actors in this field) are effectively helping to end this crime.
        This project is designed as part of a process of securing this much-needed baseline data.

        If you have any questions about the research, please contact
            Dr Rowland Seymour (rowland.seymour@nottingham.ac.uk),
            Dr Helen McCabe (helen.mccabe@nottingham.ac.uk_) or our Research Ethics Committee Chair
            via graeme.doherty@nottingham.ac.uk.
            Recent outputs from our existing work on forced marriage can be found at forcedmarriageresearch.ac.uk.

        <h3>Why are you being asked to take part in this research?</h3>
        <p>
            We want to record your view of the likely risk of forced marriage in different regions
            of the UK. You are being asked because you live and/or work or study in the UK. You may
            also be an expert in this area, but we are also interested in your opinions even if you
            don’t work in this area. Our research method relies on the “wisdom of the crowd”, so we
            want to hear from everyone.
        </p>
        <h3>What will happen to the data you give</h3>
        <p>
        We are not asking for any personal information from you that could be used to identify you.
        Your answers will be anonymous.

        We will process the data you do give us about your perception of the prevalence and risk of
        forced marriage in different regions in the UK in line with the
        University’s data-handling policies. We will keep it for as long as we are working on
        this topic. We will publish the dataset in an open-access repository so other
        researchers can use it too in future.
        </p>
        <h3>Withdrawing from the project</h3>
        <p>
        At any point in this survey, you can close your web-browser.
        If you do, your answers will not be submitted, and we won’t see them.
        If you do press “finish” on the final page, your answers will be recorded.
        As this is an anonymous survey, we can’t delete your answers after that point.
        </p>
        <h3>By clicking “I consent” you are agreeing to this use of the data you give us.</h3>
        <p>
        Many thanks for taking the time to complete our survey on this important topic.
        You answers will help us understand the prevalence of forced marriage in the UK,
        and hopefully build towards effective means of ending it by 2030 in line with the
        Sustainable Development Goals.
